				<h2 id="arno">My Name: Arno Princeston Pan</h2>
					<p>My first name, "Arno" is actually an abbreviation of the name Arnold. The name 
					comes from a Germanic root and it means Eagle. There are plenty of derivatives 
					to the name, such as "Arnauld"(French), "Arnie"(English), "Arne"(German), "Aart"
					(Dutch), "Arnaldo"(Italian) and if you would like to see more alternatives checked
					out the website, <a href="https://www.behindthename.com/name/arnold">"Behind the Name".</a></p>

				<h2 id="bio">Biography</h2>
					<p>A little about me, but not enough for stealing my identity.</p>
					
				<h3 id="ambitions">Ambitions</h3>
				<p>I want to change myself quite a bit. I think I have been focusing on my previous job for too long I forgot to focus on myself. I want to reinvent myself, start a new career and create good habits to staying 
				healthy and happy. I think what type of job I choose next will have a heavy impact as most people spend more than 8 hours a day to make a living. Other than that, I want to utilize my time properly and maximize 
				my schedule as much as possible. Hopefully, I'll walk out of this pandemic as someone new and better.</p>
					
				<h3 id="photography">Casual Photography</h3>
				<p>I love taking photos when I get the chance. I don't usually go out, but when I do. I like taking photos of objects that stand out. I do my best to make my photos interesting and I post them on Instagram. 
				However; my Instagram account is now private. So to see some of my photos, Twitter would be the best choice. There was a time that I was into film photography. Film has this grain look to its photos, due to 
				the chemical compounds on the film itself. The mystery of how photos turn out is what I like about it. I hardly do film anymore because it's costly so I stick with my digital camera (Olympus OM-D EM10 MK II) 
				and my cellphone.</p>

				<h3 id="history">History of Me</h3>
					<p>I was born in the States. And immigrated to Canada with my family, when I was a child. I was planning on going to the US for postsecondary, but didn't get into the university I wanted to get into 
					. I ended up staying in Vancouver and went to BCIT for college. I worked for a handful of years in the Construction Industry but the jobs weren't as stable as I thought they'd be. So I am here to see 
					if I could start a career in programming. Specifically in Web Programming. My struggle and story continues.</p>
					
				<h3 id="languages">Languages Spoken</h3>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/speaking.jpg" alt="Speaking Image" width="150" height="150"/>
					</figure>
					<p>My main language is "English". I speak "Mandarin" and "Taiwanese Hokkien". Other than that I understand "Japanese" as well. Enough to get around.</p>
				
				<h3 id="games">Video Games</h3>
					<p>I like to say I am only a casual gamer. But when I get into a game I tend to play that specific game for a while until I get stuck or something new comes up. Games that caught my attention are 
					"7 Days to Die", "Age Of Empires III", "Tree of Savior", "Life is Feudal: Forest Village", "Hitman", and "Days Gone". In terms of Gaming Systems, I game on the PlayStation 4 and my PC.</p>
