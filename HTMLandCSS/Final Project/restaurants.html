					<h3>Pho Tan</h3>
					<p>Thinking of noodles but don't know what sort of noodles you want? It's cold outside and you want something warm? Well, good news! 
					Pho Tan, a family owned business is still kicking in this pandemic. They can't house as many customers as they used to, but take out 
					is available. But enough about the sad part of COVID-19 life in 2020! Let's start with the spring roll. Wait? Spring Roll? I thought 
					Chinese Restaurants make Spring Rolls and not Vietnamese? No no, you have it all wrong. Their Spring Rolls are different! Pho Tan's 
					Spring Roll is extra crispy and is larger than the ones from Chinese Restaurants. They're great with the lemon grass dip. And if you 
					are into spicy sauce, their Sriracha Sauce. Of course, that's an appetizer. What I really like is their beef bowl soups. They come in 2 
					sizes. Regular and Large. They come with bean sprouts and mint leaves. Make sure you peel them off and steep these in your soup. Add some 
					lime they provide and bomb! The soup will make you feel like you're in the streets of Vietnam. So what soup? They're all from the same base, 
					the only difference between these soups are the contents. These contents include but are not limited to: </p>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Sliced Rare Beef</li>
						<li>Sliced Rare Beef & Brisket</li>
						<li>Sliced Rare Beef & Brisket & Tendon</li>
						<li>Sliced Rare Beef & Brisket & Tripe</li>
						<li>Sliced Rare Beef & Tendon</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p>That's not all of course. You could also get the rare beef cooked as well. The point is to seep the sliced rare beef in the soup for the 
					freshness feel. Kind of like a hot pot. If you don't like the base soup. <i>Why are you there dude?!</i> You can try their house special 
					soups. Such as their Pho Bo Satay (Peanut Sauce & Coconut Milk), Pho Ga Satay (Chicken Broth), Banh Canh Do Bien(Chicken Broth), 
					Pho Cha Tom(Tom Yum Broth) and Pho Kho(Seafood Broth).</p>

					<h3>George's Pizza</h3>
					<figure>
						<img 	src="images/georgespizza_resized.jpg" 
								alt="georgespizza_resized"	/>
					</figure>
					<p>Used to be one of the most attractive pizza places in Kerrisdale. Has become more of a late night meal 
					pizza place. The great thing about this place is the variety of pizzas. Their signature 3 are "The Old #5", a 
					pepperoni classic, "Hawaiian", if you like pineapple, "The Flame", if you don't mind a little spice. THe local 
					pizza place also serves some Greek dishes, but only Souvalki's (Beef, Chicken, Lamb or Grilled Salmon). You can 
					also get some Pasta (Macaroni & Cheese, Ricotta & Kal Lasagna). I will stick with the pizza though, I don't think 
					the newer chefs make the Greek or Pasta dishes often. Rating (3/5)</p>

					<h3>Sushi King</h3>
					<figure>
						<img 	src="images/sushiking_article.jpg" 
								alt="sushiking_article"	/>
					</figure>
					<p>It is hard to believe, I used to hate sushi. I didn't want to eat anything raw. I remember my mom 
					sigh in relief that I didn't like it because sashimi or good quality raw fish is expensive. Then a friend 
					of mine encouraged me to eat it more and somehow my brain rewired. And I was absolutely in love. Years later 
					I would find myself in Japan, eating one of the rawest (but fresh) seafood-don. But enough about that, 
					sometimes I get hungry and there aren't many places that are quick and convinient. Sushi King has parking 
					spots in the back and like most sushi places, if you order ahead of time you do get a discount. I usually do it 
					the day before so I can get about a 15% discount. Don't worry, they don't make the sushi the day before and leave it 
					there and wait. Other items include udon with tempura, tempura, rice bowls (salmon, tuna, chicken, beef), teryaki, 
					and they do have uni (orchid) at market rate. And don't forget for hungry parties, to get the party trays. Rating(4/5)</p>

					<h3>Donair Dude</h3>
					<figure>
						<img 	src="images/donairdude_article.jpg" 
								alt="donairdude_article"	/>
					</figure>
					<p>Not into hard spices? How about a little less focused and more simple? If you think hard spices 
					in types of food like curry is too much, have you thought about more simplier foods? But don't want 
					to get too simple with, for example, Japanese food? Well there are a whole bunch of other types of 
					foods from other countries! Known as Gyro in Greece, Kebab in the Middle East and simply Donair in 
					North America. Donair Dude, is the latest Donair you can get in the West Area of Vancouver. The spices 
					are light and mostly on the meat itself. Otherwise, there are garlic, hot, and donair sauce you can add 
					to your donair. You choose your veggies and your meat. And they put it in a nice donair wrap and toast it 
					for freshness. If you don't want any carbs you could also get donair salad (it just doesn't have the wrap 
					itself). Sides include, poutine, fries and salads like tabouli. Rating (5/5)</p>
