				<h2>Theme: Food Blog & Others</h2>
				<p>A blog showcasing places gone (for eating) and generally all about the food 
				the blogger has eaten or has visited.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				<p>The primary objective is to showcase restaurants and places gone and reviews. 
				To let the viewers know what places to try, and what places to for sure go to. 
				The secondary objective is to just see what else is going on with the blogger's life 
				other interests that may be similar to the primary objective, or in some cases not.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p>The audience would be other foodies (people into food blogging) and other people 
				that are searching for reviews for a particular restaurant or type of food. These 
				audiences would typically be in their early 20s and could go up to their 40s. Generally, 
				people that have enough computer knowledge and ability to do quick research online. The 
				majority of the audiences would be female, given food blogs are mostly produced by women. 
				The demographics would be focused on Vancouver Lower Island, and most items would be 
				introduced in English. There may be one or two items that need explanation like "what does 
				sushi mean?" a glossary page of sorts as well. The budget is for casual people or people 
				in the middle income bracket.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Pages</h2>
				
					<h3>Home</h3>
					<p>This page would have highlights the latest articles. The most popular article on the top. And smaller section for smaller articles. 
					And some other sections for non-food related articles. This page would be heavily populated. </p>
					
					<h3>Restaurants</h3>
					<p>This page showcases only Restaurant Food. Some fast-food restaurants and some more serious sit-in restaurants.</p>
					
					<h3>Cooking at Home</h3>
					<p>This page will function more like a page introducing how to make food at home. And will include recipes and reasons of why you 
					would want to eat the type of food and why the blogger had decided to make this meal. </p>
					
					<h3>Contact</h3>
					<p>This will be a typical page that includes Social Media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) and other various contacts like e-mail.</p>
					
					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>This page has some photos of the author and maybe one or two additional photos of the author having fun and enjoying life. And a description 
					about the author themselves and what they do outside of the blog and what brought them to create the page in the first plcae.</p>
					
					<h3>Various Sub-Pages</h3>
					<p>There would be various pages such as a glossary. Maybe an automatic call out to another website (hyperlink) to a dictionary website. And even 
					some page just include links to restaurant's websites or social media (Restaurants Contact Page, etc.).</p>
