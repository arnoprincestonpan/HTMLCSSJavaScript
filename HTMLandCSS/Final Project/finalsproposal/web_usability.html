				</ul>
				<p>Similar websites to my proposed website. (Final Project)</p>
				
					<h3>Foodology.ca</h3>
					<p>Positives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Simple, not a lot of colors, focuses on the content over the webpage</li>
							<li>Navigation is straight forward. You get what you click.</li>
							<li>The Search bar is at a convinient place.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Negatives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The website is very broad. It emphasizes its focus on the Canadian Foodie Trend, 
							but also has cities around the world. May have expanded a little too far.</li>
							<li>The drop down menu designed to fit into mobile devices though more suitable 
							for mobile devices. Becomes more of a hidden menu.</li>
							<li>Though simple and focused on content. The white background is too bright and 
							not suitable to be read at night.</li>
						</ul>
					
					<h3>Noms Magazine</h3>
					<p>Positives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Has a fluid scrolling animation when you scroll down.</li>
							<li>Content is focused. Layout in neighborhoods.</li>
							<li>Gallery is vast. People usually want to read little and want to see more.</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Negatives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fluid scrolling significantlly lags the website.</li>
							<li>Pages generally just lag. Maybe it has to do with the image sizes.</li>
							<li>The content is detailed, but the font is large. Because the scrolling has a 
							lag, it makes the experience less satisfying and more annoying.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<h3>Van Foodies</h3>
					<p>Positives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Loads easy, predictable website. Content is where it is.</li>
							<li>Classic top-right search box And Classic Navigation Tabs on top.</li>
							<li>Working Home Logo Button.</li>
						</ul>
						
					<p>Negatives</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Tags clog the experience.</li>
							<li>Restaurant Suggestions are in a vast list. And there are no accompanying 
							links from the blogger. It makes the audience confused on whether or not it's 
							an authentic suggestion.</li>
							<li>Content is too boxed in together. Reads more like a bulletin. There are 
							recipes and recommendations, but the main navigation doesn't make sense there 
							should either be new navigation tabs for the most important topics or more navigation 
							tabs for specific topics. "Tasty News" and "Upcoming Food Events" are too specific.</li>
						</ul>
						
				<h2>Regular Visited Website</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/dished">dished Vancouver by Daily Hive</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Daily Hive - Dished Vancouver</h3>
					<p>The website's main purpose is to let readers know about the latest news about Vancouver's 
					restaurant businesses. Specifically what to look for and what is the current events doing 
					to the industry. It also has recommendations as well. Though the main website is not focused 
					specifically just for the food. The large subcategory "dished Vancouver" is. I look at this 
					website primary due to the good intergration it has with Twitter. Most of the topics it posts, 
					has an attractive thumbnail for its article and once you click into the article the website 
					fits well into a mobile device. Though I don't like how they have too many navigation buttons to 
					click on.</p>
					
				<h2>Colourful Website</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://waaark.com/">Waark</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Waaark</h3>
					<p>What poppped out to me was the tri-colour of the website. A light maroon red, a light indigo blue 
					and a slightly dark indigo blue. I think websites with "white" is too bright for me to look at. And it 
					is too common. And there should be a dark background for less relevant information. And the lighter the 
					sections/items are the more important the information. So fonts should be in bright colours. </p>
					
				<h2>Layout Style</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.cpgd.xyz/">CPGD</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h3>CPGD by David McGillivray</h3>
					<p>The website has a lot of edges which I particularly find useful. It separates the information. 
					Modern websites have an artistic take to blend images of the website together. However; there are 
					no particular borders to differentiate the information. Sometimes a reader may need to read before 
					they know what is what. Formatting will help them focus on particular items that are separated by 
					design and not through words.</p>
