					<h3>Coffee at Home</h3>
					<p>When I was working Full-Time, what I hated but loved the most was my coffee. What do I mean? The coffee at work was made with a 
					super cheap machine. And it was rarely cleaned and I had tummy-aches all the time. But now I am at home, so I can make my own coffee. 
					How do I do it? No, not with a machine, but with something more simple from the previous century. A Moka-Pot. A Traditional Moka-Pot was 
					made with aluminum and they are still sold in stores and you can find them in book stores as well. However; aluminum is controvercial 
					and high amount of aluminum contact is linked to health problems. So, I got a steel version instead. Steel Moka pots are compatiable 
					with induction stoves as well, so if you live in a condo like me. You'd need it.</p>
					
					<h4>Ingredients & Items</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Moka Pot <i>Make Sure you can use it on your stove.</i></li>
						<li>Coffee of your Choice</li>
						<li>Water Boiler</li>
						<li>Rag or Oven Gloves</li>
						<li>A large spoon you drink soup with.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Steps</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Boil some Water in your water boiler or other pot.</li>
						<li>Set your rag on the counter.</li>
						<li>Unscrew your Moka Pot bottom. Set coffee tray aside.</li>
						<li>Place the Moka Pot Bottom on the rag. <i>If you have oven gloves you don't really need to do this.</i></li>
						<li>Scoop up a spoonful of grinded coffee. Place it in the coffee tray and put it onto the Moka Pot Bottom.</li>
						<li>Using the rag to cover your palm. Carefully. Screw back the Moka Pot bottom.</li>
						<li>Put the Moka Pot on medium heat.</li>
						<li>When you hear a bubbling sound. Or water boiling loudly. Remove from heat and run cold water on the pot in the sink.</li>
						<li>Serve! Do it YOUR way.</li>
					</ol>
