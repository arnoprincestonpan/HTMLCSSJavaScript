		<h2>Reason for taking COMP 1850</h2>
		<p>After being laid off from my construction estimator job after COVID-19, I have realized the scalability of my job is limited. 
		In the time off, I wanted to enter the September 2020 to May 2021 Software Systems Developer program. I didn't know we could reserve a seat before entering the program.
		So, I didn't send in an application form until I finished my COMP 1409 course. By then the program was full. Instead of sitting around, I have decided to take as many Part-Time
		Courses as possible in the CST Program. Web Programming, being my eventual goal, COMP 1850 is a for sure course from BCIT. It's been over a decade since I have touched html.
		So I only remember the basic mark-ups. Other than that, I remember creating a drop down menu. I hope I will slowly be able to pick things up and be confident that I will 
		go through course swiftly and learn new things that will shape my possible career in web programming.
