                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>I am taking COMP 2132 to complete my Computer Systems Certificate, and to learn one of the most popular languages, "Javascript". 
                    Hopefully I can absorb as much information as possible and learn techniques that help me in becoming a good developer. 
                </p>

                            <h3>Street Photography</h3>
                            <p>When I go out, especially if it's sunny or even sometimes rainy, I whip out my phone and just snap photos of the scenary. I kind of 
                                like to capture that moment. That feeling.

                            <h3>Gaming</h3>
                            
                            <p>Before the pandemic I was already a gamer. I don't think I would classify as a hardcore gamer since
                                I have friends that are more dedicated to their games. Sometimes in shocking amounts of hours. I love 
                                creative games, where you can build the environments. But sometimes shoot them ups are pretty fun.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Streaming</h3>
                            <p>I think one of the guilty pleasures of the modern multimedia world is streaming channels. I remember when 
                                the Blockbuster generation would be judged for swiping 3 movies per weekend. And now we have people binge watch 
                                entire seasons on the weekends. However; I tend to watch a few episodes a day. I don't get as invested in dramas 
                                anymore as sometimes they're too cliche. My classics are, "The Walking Dead", "Supernatural" and "Family Guy".

                            <h3>Analog Photography</h3>
                            <p>I honestly love technology. But I am also amazed with how things used to work. Especially the way people used to take 
                                photos. Back when I was a kid, the digital camera quality just wasn't good enough. Analog was always ahead, until it wasn't. 
                                I do develop black and white film from time to time after shooting 35mm film. But haven't done this for a while since the pandemic.

                            <h3>Foodie Culture</h3> 
                            <p>I used to not eat a lot due to stomach problems. But later on I got better so I started taking in more food. And got into the local 
                                food culture, where people would take photos of their food and post them on Instagram. I don't do that as much but when I get the 
                                chance I check out new places and revisit my favorite places and take photos of food I am about to eat.

                            <h3>Baseball</h3>
                            <p>I am not a sportive guy. But I do enjoy watching sports from time to time. Coming from a family of Baseball 
                                fans it was hard not to pick-up the like of baseball. I do like local baseball such as the Vancouver Canadians.
                                But haven't been able to see them play locally since the pandemic. Other than that I enjoy other leagues too!
                                (i.e. CPBL, WBC, MLB, MiLB)

                            <p>I think from all I learned from high school was developing my personality. In elementary school I was quite timid around people I 
                                didn't know. But when high school hit. I was a chatterbox. Other than that, I think even though it was a while ago, my high school 
                                greatly shaped what type of person I am today.

                            <p>I can't say I got any credits or anything from this school. I think it is a good school if you live close to it. I was a student at
                                SFU Burnaby for over a year but decided to quit because I did not want to stay in engineering. I did consider Computing Science but 
                                was not confident with my skills and dropped out and decided to pursue Architecture elsewhere.

                            <h3>British Columbia Institute of Technology</h3>
                            <p>I couldn't find a school that did construction until I looked at BCIT one more time. I had applied for BCIT back in the day but chose 
                                Engineering and decided not to go into it. Thinking back I should of just went straight to BCIT. I finished my diploma in Architectural 
                                Building Technology and worked as an estimator for a handful of years, but came out of it unhappy. So, I decided to try to find my bearings 
                                again. I initially intended to go to SSD, but was convinced to try to get into CST's Diploma. So far, I find coding interesting and rewarding. 
                                That ability to create, like this website. Still amazes me. I hope I only get better. And complete my education as soon as possible.

                            <h3>HTML</h3>
                            <p>I first got to code with HTML in highschool. Later on I took COMP 1850. But it was way different than I remembered. I think there was 
                                a lot more structure going on at BCIT compared to what we did in highschool. I love it, I think it's one of the most easiest but it 
                                is a nightmare when you start adding tons of content.

                            <p>I don't remember touching CSS back in highschool. But I remember knowing that it is used to make HTML look awesome. In COMP 1850, I was 
                                able to play with it more and make some websites. Similar to this one I have. I think there are a lot of tips and tricks out there that 
                                I am still not familiar with but hopefully I get to get better and learn and retain as many of them.

                            <p>The language that they used to teach first. That's what people tell me. I did start Java briefly in highschool. I don't know how but I remember 
                                creating a game back then. But somehow after taking a few courses at BCIT, I still can't recreate what I think I made back in highschool. However; I 
                                think I learned a lot more structure at BCIT. Understanding OOPS more and understanding how to save time with it.
